# ⚡ EVXchange

EVXchange is a peer-to-peer electric vehicle (EV) charging station platform — think AirBnB, but for home and public parking lot chargers. EV owners can search, view, and book nearby charging spots hosted by individuals or businesses. Hosts can monetize their unused chargers. The platform features secure authentication, real-time location mapping, seamless booking, payments, and reviews.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔐 **Authentication** via LinkedIn, Google, or Facebook (with user/admin roles)
- 🗺️ **Google Maps integration** to explore nearby chargers
- 🧾 **Booking system** with availability and pricing
- 💳 **Stripe payments** for secure transactions
- ⭐ **Ratings & reviews** for transparency and trust
- 🧑‍💻 **Flask backend** with RESTful API (admin-only endpoints, dynamic user profiles)
## 👤 User Roles & Profiles

- Users have roles: `user` (default) or `admin` (seeded from `.env`)
- Admins can access special dashboard and endpoints
- Profile page allows editing name and avatar; new fields appear automatically as the model evolves
## 🛠️ Admin Seeding

The initial admin user is seeded using `ADMIN_EMAIL` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` from your `.env` file. All other users default to role `user`.
- ⚛️ **React frontend** for fast, modern UI
